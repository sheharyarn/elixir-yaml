> YAML Encoding and Decoding in Elixir

This library is a lightweight wrapper around the erlang [`yamerl`][yamerl] package
and provides a clean and intuitive way to encode and decode YAML in Elixir.



## Installation

Add `yaml` to your project dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:yaml, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```



## Usage

To decode YAML, call the `YAML.decode/1` method:

```elixir
string = """
invoice: 34843
date   : 2001-01-23
bill-to: &id001
    given  : Chris
    family : Dumars
    address:
        lines: |
            458 Walkman Dr.
            Suite #292
        city    : Royal Oak
        state   : MI
        postal  : 48046
ship-to: *id001
product:
    - sku         : BL394D
      quantity    : 4
      description : Basketball
      price       : 450.00
    - sku         : BL4438H
      quantity    : 1
      description : Super Hoop
      price       : 2392.00
tax  : 251.42
total: 4443.52
comments: >
    Late afternoon is best.
    Backup contact is Nancy
    Billsmer @ 338-4338.
"""
